# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by Continuum frontend team, feel free to write as much notes as possible to help the team.

## If you had more time what would you have done?

* In exercise two, I would improve the user experience with smooth animations. e.g Buttons
* In exercise three, I would add the field of seconds. See the changes on countdown only on each minute, looks like the counter doesn't work.

## If there anything else we should know about the submission?

I created a gulp task named deploy. This task I would run it before a full deploy of the project for a production environment to minify the HTML files. I didn't run it before to facilitate the reading of the document.
